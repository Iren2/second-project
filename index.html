        <h2> Know Me</h2>
        <p>
            We all experience anger in our lives. Uncontrolled anger, however, can create problems in our relationships and even with our health. All of this can lead to more stress and additional problems, which can complicate life and keep us from being our best selves. That's why learning to manage and eventually let go of anger is so important to becoming a better person.

            Letting go of anger isn't always easy, but the first step in anger management is learning more about recognizing anger and knowing what to do when you feel angry in your life.
            
            Recognizing anger is often simple if you make an effort to notice when you feel upset and decide to manage this feeling rather than denying it or lashing out at others as a way of coping. Focus on noticing when you feel angry and why, and know that there is a difference between feeling angry and acting on that anger. Then know your options.
        </p>
        Remind yourself that maybe that person who cut you off in traffic was distracted by something challenging in their own life. If a friend seems to be rude to you, inquire about how their day is going and find out if there's more that you don't know.

        You can also focus on what your "anger triggers" are, and eliminate them as possible. For example, if you find yourself becoming frustrated and angry when you have to rush, work on making more space in your schedule (even if it means saying no a little more), and try to eliminate that trigger. If a certain person makes you angry, try to limit their role in your life if it doesn't work to talk things out with them first.
        
        It's also important to learn to let go of grudges and residual anger from each day. Don't wake up holding a grudge from the night before if you can help it. Focus on forgiveness, even if it means you don't still let have an important role in your life. Stay in the present moment as much as possible, and this becomes easier.
        
        Practicing stress relievers like meditation can also help you to let go of anger. Focus on releasing the hold that the past may have on you. Put your attention on the current moment and it becomes easier to avoid rumination and stay in a good place.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Helping others may seem like an obvious route to becoming a better person in that we often think of "good people" as those who are willing to sacrifice for others. This, in the minds of many, is what makes a person "good." However, good deeds can also make us better people because of the connection between altruism and emotional well-being.

According to research, it just may be true that it's better to give than to receive. So while you may feel too stressed and busy worrying about your own problems and those of your family to extend that help to others when it's not absolutely necessary, expanding your ability to focus on the needs of others can really help you as well. It’s true: altruism is its own reward and can actually help you relieve stress.
